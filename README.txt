RouteFinder_V1.0

Now compatible with phpVMS 5.5x by Simpilot
================

This one is a module for your pilots to directly search for their routes from your website rather than going to the actual website. 
Don't worry I checked that website and it's free to use.

Install:

1. Unzip the folder anywhere you want.
2. Upload in the order of folders.
3. make a link to the module like this <?php echo url('/rfinder') ;?>.
4. Enjoy.
